# FID-Evaluator
The FID Evaluator is a tool for evaluating the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID). The FID is a metric to evaluate the quality of synthesized to real images. 
To do this, the feature vectors of the images are first calculated using the [Inception v3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inceptionv3) model and then the FID is determined by comparing the mean values and the covariances using the following formula:

$$d_F\left(\mathcal{N}\left(\mu, \sum\right), \mathcal{N}\left(\mu', \sum'\right)\right)^2 = ||\mu - \mu'||_2^2 + \text{tr}\left(\sum + \sum' - 2\left(\sum\sum'\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\right).$$

We use a principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the embedding space in order to better match the dimensional space (2048 dimensions) to the real images.
To evaluate this, we noise the synthesized images and compare the percentage increase starting from the first FID value of the respective dimensional reduction of the embedding space.

Since very specific images are usually generated, we take advantage of this by fitting a PCA on the very similar, specific feature vectors. This is because we are usually not interested in the very rich information in the vector space of the Inception v3 model, but only in a very small area. By reducing to the essential information of the embedding space, the information otherwise contained, which is also reflected in covariances and mean values, can no longer influence the FID.

# Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jonah-gr/FID-Evaluator.git
cd FID-Evaluator
pip install .
```

# Usage
The following three steps need to be executed after each other: compute_features, pca, and fid.


## 1. Compute Features

To compute features from real and fake images, use the compute_features mode:

```bash
python -m src.main compute_features -r /path/to/real/images -f /path/to/fake/images --noise "0.25 0.5" --noise_types all
```

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Command&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Description | Tip |
|    :-:    | --- | --- |
| -r / --real | Path to the real images | |
| -f / --fake | Path to the fake images | |
| -d / --device | Device to use: cpu or cuda | If no device is specified, cuda is used if it is available, otherwise cpu. |
| --noise | The level of distortion, e.g. "0.25 0.5" | See the differences of the levels [here](/public/Figure_1.png). Default: "0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4". Mix noise types also accept tuples, so that the different applied noise types can be applied with different noise levels.|
| --noise_types | The type of distortion | See the differences of the types [here](/public/Figure_1.png). Default: "gauss". If "all", every noise type will be used. With "mix [swirl, rectangles]", the noise types in brackets can be used in this exact order. |
| --pkl_file | Path to the pickle file | Default: "features.pkl" |

This will compute features from the specified real and fake images, with optional noise applied. The computed features will be saved to a pickle file.


## 2. Perform PCA

To perform PCA on the computed features, use the pca mode:

```bash
python -m src.main pca -n "10 25 50 100 200 300"
```

| Command | Description | Tip |
| :-: | --- | --- |
| -n / --n_components | The dimensions to which the feature vectors are reduced | Default: 100. With e.g. `-n "range(2, 7, 2), 3"`, `2, 3, 4, 6` are used as n_components. "range" works here as in basic python. |
| --pkl_file | Path to the pickle file | Default: "features.pkl" |

This will perform PCA on the computed features with the specified number of components. The transformed features will be saved back to the pickle file.

## 3. Calculate FID
   
To calculate the FID score, use the fid mode:


```bash
python -m src.main fid
```

| Command | Description | Tip |
| :-: | --- | --- |
| --pkl_file | Path to the pickle file | Default: "features.pkl" |

This will load the features from the pickle file and calculate the FID score for the different noise types and levels. 
The plots will show the percentage increase of the FID scores and not the FID itself.

# Example

On test images of [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjilkarki/deepfake-and-real-images) we got the following results: 
![example results](/public/deepfake_results.png)
So you can clearly see that for this particular dataset, reducing the dimensions to 16 or even fewer makes the FID metric much more sensitive than the standard 2048 dimensions. According to our method, the FID therefore recognizes more quickly if the images generated by GAN networks or diffusion models, for example, contain more errors.

# Explanation

The feature vectors are saved in a dictionary, which in turn is saved in a pickle file (features.pkl). The same file is extended by the reduced vectors in the pca step. The dictionary should then look something like this:

```python
features_dict = {"real":
                        {"no pca": []},
                        {"pca": 
                                {100: []}},
                "fake": 
                        {"no pca": 
                                {"gauss": 
                                        {0.0: [],
                                        0.25: []},
                                "swirl": 
                                        {0.0: [],
                                        0.25: []}},
                        "pca": 
                                {100:
                                        {"gauss": 
                                                {0.0: [],
                                                0.25: []},
                                        "swirl": 
                                                {0.0: [],
                                                0.25: []}
                                        }
                                }
                        }
                }
```
The respective feature vectors can then be found in the lists.

The FID-Evaluator supports 5 different noise types: 

| noise_type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| "gauss" | Gaussian noise |
| "blur" | Gaussian blur |
| "swirl" | swirled images |
| "rectangles" | implanted black rectangles |
| "salt_and_pepper" | salt and pepper noise |
